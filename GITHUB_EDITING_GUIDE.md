6. **Fork the Repository**
   - As a last resort, you can fork the repository to your account
   - Make changes to the fork
   - Create a pull request to merge changes back to the original repo

## GitHub Permission Types Explained

Understanding GitHub permissions can help diagnose issues:

- **Read**: Can only view and clone the repository
- **Triage**: Can read and manage issues and pull requests
- **Write**: Can read, clone, push, and manage repository content
- **Maintain**: Same as write, plus some admin functions
- **Admin**: Full control over the repository

According to our permissions check, you have Admin access which should allow you to edit any file.
